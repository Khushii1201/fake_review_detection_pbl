# AI-Based Fake Review Detection

## Project Overview
This project detects fake product reviews using:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- TF-IDF Feature Extraction
- Logistic Regression Classification
- Fuzzy Logic Decision Layer

## Dataset
Amazon Reviews Dataset (Kaggle)

## Implementation Workflow
Dataset → NLP Cleaning → TF-IDF → Logistic Regression → Probability → Fuzzy Logic → Final Output

## Model Performance
- Balanced Dataset Accuracy: ~70%
- Full Dataset Accuracy: ~90% (imbalanced)
- Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Future Scope
- Browser Extension Deployment
- Larger Dataset Training
- Deep Learning Integration
